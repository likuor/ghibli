### Why made me create this app?

My favorite movie team, Ghibli studio made tons of popular movies in the world. Whenever I talk about movies from the team, I couldn't translate to English title and what is like so I decided to make a simple bookmark app to show those great movies. Also, I wanted to learn Redux well and check how to use Antdesign in my curiosity. 

### What was challenging?

How Redux works (action, view, dispatch, store, reducer), Customizeing AntDesign. And relation of rendering system and redux dispatching. When I made categories function, it made me suffer a lot.
