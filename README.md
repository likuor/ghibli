### Why made me create this app?

My favorite movie team, Ghibli studio made tons of popular movies in the world. Whenever I talk about movies from the team, I couldn't translate to English title and what is like so I decided to make a simple bookmark app to show those great movies. Also, I wanted to learn Redux well and check how to use Antdesign in my curiosity. 

### What was challenging?

How Redux works (action, view, dispatch, store, reducer), Customizeing AntDesign.

### Goals for Improvement

I regret I didn't implement Redux for this project. I should have designed file structures first to see how big is this project going to be. If so, I could have used Redux for a more approachable and organized data design. My improvement for my next project will be sufficient preparation including mockup design, file structure, database structure, and research of language, libraries, and APIs. -->
